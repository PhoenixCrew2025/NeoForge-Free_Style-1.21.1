ðŸ“¢ **Development Update on FreeStyle Mod**

Hello everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to provide a clear and detailed update regarding the current status of the **FreeStyle Mod**. Iâ€™ve noticed that some players and community members are expecting an update, so I feel itâ€™s important to make things fully transparent about where the project stands right now.

At this time, **FreeStyle Mod has not received any new updates or changes**. The main reason for this is that my development efforts have recently been focused on a different but connected project: the **Ecreate Mod**, which is being built as part of the upcoming update to the **Easy Create Modpack**. I am currently in the process of transitioning the Easy Create Modpack over to **NeoForge for Minecraft 1.21.1**, which has introduced new coding challenges and technical hurdles that I needed to work through.

To explain further:

* When I started updating Easy Create, I encountered some compatibility issues with the newer **NeoForge codebase**. NeoForge is different from the older Forge setup I was used to working with, and while it brings a lot of improvements for long-term support and stability, it also means that some of the familiar coding structures and methods have changed.
* Because of this, I tried to reuse and adapt certain parts of the **FreeStyle Mod code** as a reference and testing ground. My idea was to rely on what I already know and understand from FreeStyle in order to smooth out the process of coding the new version of Ecreate. Unfortunately, this approach hasnâ€™t fully worked out yet due to the new systems and requirements in NeoForge.
* This means that I had to prioritize troubleshooting and experimenting within **Ecreate** before being able to circle back and make meaningful progress on FreeStyle.

So, to be absolutely clear:

* **FreeStyle Mod remains unchanged for now.** There are no updates, patches, or content additions at this moment.
* All development work has been focused on preparing **Ecreate** and **Easy Create Modpack** for the 1.21.1 NeoForge environment.
* Once I resolve the issues on the NeoForge side and stabilize the Easy Create update, I will be in a much better position to return to FreeStyle and consider how best to move it forward.

I understand this may be disappointing to some of you who were looking forward to new features or bug fixes in FreeStyle, but I want to assure you that the project is not abandoned. It is simply on hold while I put the necessary work into ensuring the foundation of my other projects is strong enough to build on.

Thank you so much for your patience, understanding, and continued support. Developing mods across different versions and loaders can sometimes be a slower process than expected, especially when transitioning to a new framework like NeoForge. Your feedback and encouragement mean a lot, and I will keep you updated as soon as thereâ€™s meaningful progress to share on FreeStyle Mod.

â€“ Ezekiel (Developer of FreeStyle / Ecreate / Easy Create Modpack)
